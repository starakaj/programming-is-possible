# Midterm Preparation

## Reading
We're preparing for a group project next week, so the reading should get you in the mindset of group software work.

- "The Scrum Guide" which you can download here https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html.
- "Why 'Agile' and especially Scrum are terrible" https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/why-agile-and-especially-scrum-are-terrible/
- Watch "Connected Worlds" https://nysci.org/home/exhibits/connected-worlds/

## Miderm Assignment

This isn't a full description of the assignment, but rather it's just a bit of prep work to get you ready for the assignment. We're going to be using the midterm to put together all the knowledge that we've accumulated so far. The project will:

- Take readings from a Raspberry Pi.
- Push that data server and store it in MongoDB.
- Present that data through a client-facing API.
- Display the data in a client-side, React powered web app.

It's a bit of a funny way to work, in that I'm telling you what pieces you have to use but not what you should use them for. But this basic backbone is extremely flexible and can drive a huge number of different projects. So prepare for the next class by answering the following questions:

- What kind of story can you tell with data gathered from a Raspberry Pi?
- What kind of sensor data do you want to work with?
- How can you analyze that data once its in a database?
- What might someone on the client side want to do with that data?
- How does that data become meaningful for someone?
