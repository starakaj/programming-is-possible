# Homework 00

## Due Date
This assignment follows the first lesson, [00-intro](../lessons/00-intro/00-intro.md). There is a written portion! It must be turned in by midnight the day before class. You can turn in the assignment by sending it to me in an email attachment, or by sending me a link to a github repository.

## Assignment
### Reading
- Aron Z. Lewis, _Inside the Digital Sensorium_, https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2021/01/17/inside-the-digital-sensorium/

The very first thing we do in the second class will be to discuss this reading. The article isn't long, and I recommend reading it twice if you can, once after class and once again before we meet the second time. Some things that you might want to think about:

- Which of the eight short stories do you identify with most?
- Do you think a website is like a physical place? How do you feel about comparing a website to a sense organ?
- What are the parts of this article that make you feel hopeful? What parts make you uncomfortable?
- What is Instagram? An app? A product? A company? A collection of images and videos? All of these? None of them?

If you want to make sure you're prepared for discussion, a nice technique is QCQ - Quote, Comment, Question. Make sure that you write down one quote from the reading, that you have some comment on it, and that you have a question about it.

### Writing
In addition to the reading assignment this week, there will be a brief writing assignment. I want you to choose a piece of networked art, and to tell me how it works. Your interpretation of networked art can be as broad as you like, but it should be a piece that has multiple, distributed, coordinated parts. Similar to the breakdown we did in class, you should be able to answer:

- What are the major parts of the system? What are their responsibilities?
- How does the behavior of the system change if one of the parts is non-responsive?
- What are the hardware and software components of each part? Can you make any specific guesses?
- How do the parts communicate? What protocols do they use?

Here's a list of some networked art pieces you can use:
- David Bowen: https://www.dwbowen.com/telepresentwater — Tele-present water
- Collective Of Two: https://vimeo.com/386776425 — Invisible Hand
- eCLOUD: http://www.ecloudproject.com/
- The Living: http://cheraudesir.com/the-living-twin-mirror-2017/ - Twin Mirror
- Ronin Tool: https://100r.co/site/ronin.html
- The Living: https://architizer.com/projects/living-light/ - Living Light
- Matt Roberts: https://vimeo.com/20500963 - Waves
- Matt Kenyon: https://www.swamp.nu/projects/spore - Spore 1.1

### Extra Reading

If you're relatively unfamiliar with Node, Git, or JavaScript itself, I *highly* recommend brushing up before coming to class on Wednesday.

#### Git
- http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html
- https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

#### Node
- https://medium.com/@jesterxl/introduction-bde654b5670e (don't worry so much about all the specific libraries, but _do_ think about they do)

#### JavaScript

## Handing it in
The only part of this assignment that must be handed in is the writing assignment. Again, about 500 words should be enough. For this assignment, you can either (1) create a git repository and check the writing in as a .txt or a .md file, or you can (2) email me the assignment at st2774@nyu.edu.
