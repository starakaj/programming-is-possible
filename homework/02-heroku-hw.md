## Tic Tac Toe

Start by downloading the starter I made for you at https://github.com/starakaj/react-express-starter. You can download it as a zip, or fork the repo and start from there, up to you. Next, implement tic-tac-toe.

```
   a     b     c
      |     |     
1  -  |  -  |  -  
 _____|_____|_____
      |     |     
2  -  |  -  |  -  
 _____|_____|_____
      |     |     
3  -  |  -  |  -  
      |     |     
```

In case you need a reminder, the way tic tac toe works, two players take turns putting an X or an O in each square. If either player gets three in a row, including diagonals, that player wins.

### Requirements
- The game must display which player, X or O, has the current turn.
- There must be an indication when one player or the other wins.
- Use a different React component for the game container and for the squares.
- Put it up on Heroku
- Chose at least one of the optional requirements.

### Optional
- There must be a way to reset the game (refreshing the page doesn't count).
- Let the players set their names at the start of the game.
- Color the squares differently for X and O using CSS classes.
- Make it possible to undo a move.
- Set the number of rows or columns at the start of the game.

### Considerations
- The trickiest part of this assignment is handling clicks on the squares. The individual squares are dumbâ€”they can't know anything about the state of the game. Rather, each square should have an `onClick` prop, similar to a button.
- If you chose to let the players set their names, you probably don't want to use a `post` Express handler. Remember, React has the state, not Express.
