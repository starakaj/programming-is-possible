## Essential Questions
- How does remote data gathering work?
- How do large teams work on software together?
- How do multiple people collaborate on software projects?
- How do you keep a large software project organized?
- What kind of data can a Raspberry Pi gather? How?
- How can that data be presented in a useful way?

## Introduction
We've been building skills for weeks now, it's time to put them to the test. We've seen how to build a web server that exposes an API for creating, modifying and deleting data. We've programmed a Raspberry Pi to gather data and upload it remotely. Finally, we've built a front end that presents data from the server in an illustrative, attractive format. These are all the pieces of a complete, end-to-end software application.

What we haven't done yet is put all those pieces together. Rather than have each person build the whole application, we're going to divide the project up and work on the whole thing as a class. Hopefully the experience will give everyone a flavor for what it's like to work on a large software application, and hopefully it will be fun.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This module is part of DM-GY 6063, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In working on this midterm assignment, we'll be working on three major parts of a large software application, a user-facing frontend, a data-persisting backend, and a data-gathering piece of custom hardware.
* Through this experience, we'll learn how to coordinate a large project among many people.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
TBD. Maybe something about product ownership or management?

### Vocabulary (example)
TBD

## Midterm Description
