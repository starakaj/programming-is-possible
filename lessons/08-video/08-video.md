## Essential Questions
- How do computers encode audio and video data?
- What are the salient features of audio and video?
- How can we detect and analyze those features?
- What are some creative applications?

## Introduction
Last week we talked about analyzing a live audio stream, using the output to direct a drawing in real time. In this class we'll look at something similar: analyzing a video to extract salient features. We'll be leaning heavily on a computer vision library called OpenCV. 

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This module is part of DM-GY 9103, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this class we'll be working with video recordings, as well as live video streams. We'll look at how computers represent this data, and we'll explore some software libraries for analyzing that data.
* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of how video analysis works. They'll take away some useful tools for performing that analysis, and they'll have exposure to creative techniques for working with extracted features.

### Pacing / Duration
TBD

## Materials Needed
TBD, but certainly a laptop and a browser. Other helpful software:
- Meyda.js
- Synopsis
- Max/MSP
- Freesound/Essentia

### Exercises To Do Before Class
TBD. Maybe a reading about Luke's work with SPL measurements? Maybe something from sonic weapons?

### Vocabulary (example)
* Feature - (find a good definition of this, it's not trivial).
* Envelope - The slow-moving amplitude of a sound, related to its loudness. Commonly divided into Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release portions for modeling instruments.
* Optical Flow - A matrix describing the flow of pixels between images (needs a better definitions).
* Spectrum - A power-histogram representation of the frequency content of a signal.
* Discrete Fourier Transform - A function for transforming a series of samples from a time domain representation to a frequency domain representation.
* Harmonic - Sounds whose spectral content is mostly grouped into bands, the center frequencies of which are whole number multiples of each other.
* Face Tracking - Automatically estimating the position of a face in an image or video, possibly including its size and orientation.
